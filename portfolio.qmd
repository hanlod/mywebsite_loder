Explore my projects below. I use different mediums to share important stories impacting my community and the nation. I value the perspectives I am able to lift up in my reporting. I am grateful for the opportunity to meet new people and help tell their stories.

## Street Sense Media Articles

I wrote these articles during an editorial internship with Street Sense Media in the summer of 2022. I did the reporting, writing, worked with editors and took photos for the articles.

I created these audio and video projects using Adobe Audition, After Effects and Premiere Pro. They focus on environmental issues and are published on Planet Forward, a sustainability reporting outlet.
